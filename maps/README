The xpilots program will probably not find these maps automatically (if you
haven't specified the correct MAPDIR), so you will have to specify the
whole path.

You will need to uncompress and extract the files from the tar archive, i.e:

	zcat maps.tar.Z | tar xvf -

		or

	uncompress maps.tar.Z
	tar xvf maps.tar
