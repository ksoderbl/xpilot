(NOTE, these fonts are not needed by xpilot (or xpilots), they are provided
merely as a help for those of you who want to use a standard text editor to
generate maps.)

First, make the fonts (done in the directory where the .bdf files are):

ksh:
	for font in map*.bdf
	do
		bdftosnf $font | compress > ${font%%.bdf}.scf
	done
	mkfontdir

To install these fonts in your font-path, use the following commands:

	xset fp+ <this-directory>
	xset fp rehash
