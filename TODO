Hi priority:
------------
- Fix limited lives

Medium priority:
----------------
- The collision detection is a mess, WallCollide() should call Landing()
  if the object is a player.
- Wrap-around doesn't work correctly.

Low priority:
----------------
- Give special items weight (done?)
- Use mouse for navigation
- Graphical help window (should be cleaned up)
- Radar should draw real blocks, not just pixels
