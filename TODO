TODO list for XPilot
====================
- double buffering on labels. (?)
- thrust flame moved a little further back.
- bouncing.
- better detection of servers and contact mechanism (TCP instead of UDP maybe).
- more bitplanes/colours, at least the possibility to determine this yourself.
- no players may have the same name, maybe save player ratings.
- enhance team option (team with names, own colors and home bases?)
- make an xp-ed (xpilot-ed) map editor.
