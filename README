NOTE:
\\\\\

The documentation is far from complete, though we have tried to remove
all the errors from it.  Because of lack of time, the map format is
only explained in README.MAPS and README.MAPS2, not in the server
manual page (xpilots(6)).  The client manual page (xpilot(6)) is more
or less up to date.



REQUIREMENTS:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\

XPilot require the following resources:

    - An ANSI compiler  (gcc with gcc-includes installed should work just fine)
    - X11               (only R4 and R5 tested)

Also note that XPilot generates heavy netload and isn't gentle with the X
server, so a fast machine in a fast network is the ideal situation.



INSTALLATION:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\

*   In the src directory, edit the config.h and Imakefile files to suit
    your environment.  If you don't have Imake, you can use Makefile.std
    (just rename it to Makefile and type 'make' for more info).

*   If you have Imake, issue the following command:

        xmkmf -a

    If it fails (xmkmf doesn't understand the -a flag), do

        xmkmf
        make Makefiles
        make includes
        make depend

*   Now compile:

        make

    If you get lots of parse errors, then verify that you're using an
    ANSI compiler.

    If you're compiling with gcc and get conflicting types for `abort'
    and `exit', check that your include files has prototypes and if not,
    that you have installed gcc-includes.  You should always install
    gcc-includes if your system include files doesn't have prototypes.
    (As a temporary hack, you may remove #include <stdlib.h> from all
    the files.)

*   Copy the maps to a suitable place (as specified in the config.h file).
    On our system we have the LIBDIR set to /user/local/games/lib/xpilot.
    An /bin/ls -l on this directory gives:

        total 500
        -rw-r--r--   1 bjoerns  staff        739 Jun 25 02:27 defaults
        -rw-rw-rw-   1 bjoerns  staff     29859  May  5 21:32 log	(+)
        drwxr-xr-x   2 bjoerns  staff      1024  Apr  5 16:16 maps
        -rw-r--r--   1 bjoerns  staff       320  Jun 20 13:20 motd
        -rw-r--r--   1 bjoerns  staff       320  Jun 20 13:20 motd

    (+)Note, if you have logging enabled you will have to touch a file called
       log in the LIBDIR and give other users write permission to it. This is
       necessary since xpilot hasn't, and shouldn't have, the setuid bit set.

    Also note that the `motd' isn't included, you should make one yourself
    if you feel the need for it.

*   If you want to use sound (rplay or NCD displays needed), copy the
    src/lib/sounds file to LIBDIR+"sounds".

*   Copy the manual pages to a suitable place.  If you don't know where to
    put them, don't bother.  You may still read them with the following
    command:

        nroff -man <man-file> | col | more
