Please see the LICENSE file for further details, in addition you may not
distribute this project without this file (README) included.



REQUIREMENTS:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\

XPilot require the following resources:

    - An ANSI compiler  (GCC with no options should work just fine)
    - X11               (only R4 and R5 tested)

Also note that XPilot generates heavy netload and isn't gentle with the X
server, so a fast machine in a fast network is the ideal situation.



INSTALLATION:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\

*   Cd to the src directory.

*   Edit the config.h and Imakefile files to suit your environment.  If you
    don't have Imake, you may have to hack a bit on Makefile.std.

*   If you have Imake, issue the following command:

        xmkmf -a

*   Now make:

        make

*   Copy the maps to a suitable place (as specified in the config.h file).
    On our system we have the LIBDIR set to /user/local/games/lib/xpilot.
    An /bin/ls -l on this directory gives:

        total 500
        -rw-rw-rw-   1 bjoerns  siving90   29859  May  5 21:32 log	(+)
        drwxr-xr-x   2 bjoerns  siving90    1024  Apr  5 16:16 maps
        -rw-r--r--   1 bjoerns  siving90     320  Jun 20 13:20 motd

    (+)Note, if you have logging enabled you will have to touch a file called
       log in the LIBDIR and give other users write permission to it. This is
       necessary since xpilot hasn't, and shouldn't have, the setuid bit set.

    Also note that the `motd' isn't included, you should make one yourself
    if you feel the need for it.

*   Copy the manual pages to a suitable place.  If you don't know where to
    put them, don't bother.  You may still read them with the following
    command:

        nroff -man <man-file> | col | more
