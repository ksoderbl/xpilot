NOTE:
\\\\\

The documentation is far from complete, though we have tried to remove
all the errors from it.  Because of lack of time, the map format is
only explained in README.MAPS and README.MAPS2, not in the server
manual page (xpilots(6)).  The client manual page (xpilot(6)) is more
or less up to date.


VMS:
\\\\

*   VMS users should examine the VMS subdirectory and read the README.VMS
    which is in there.


REQUIREMENTS:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\

XPilot require the following resources:

   - An ANSI C compiler (gcc with gcc-includes installed should work just fine,
                         though many default compilers (like Sun's) are NOT
                         ANSI C compliant so check and double check that the
                         compiler you plan to use is ANSI C compliant.
                         About 95% of all the problems reported is because
                         users are not using an ANSI C compliant compiler!)
   - X11                (only R4 and R5 tested, but R6 has been reported to work too)

Also note that XPilot generates heavy netload and isn't gentle with the X
server, so a fast machine in a fast network is the ideal situation.


INSTALLATION:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\

*   Change current directory to the src directory.

*   Edit the config.h and Imakefile files to suit your environment.
    You must define where you will put the XPilot lib directory and
    possibly the XPilot maps directory too if it will not be in the
    lib directory.  Also, there are likely to be some compiler
    flags which you may need to enable.
    If you don't have Imake, you can use Makefile.std
    (just rename it to Makefile and type 'make' for more info).

*   If you have Imake, issue the following command:

        xmkmf -a

    If it fails (xmkmf doesn't understand the -a flag), do

        xmkmf
        make Makefiles
        make includes
        make depend

*   Now compile:

        make

    If you get lots of errors, verify that you're using an ANSI C compiler.

    If you're compiling with gcc and get conflicting types for `abort'
    and `exit', check that your include files has prototypes and if not,
    that you have installed gcc-includes.  You should always install
    gcc-includes if your system include files doesn't have prototypes.
    (As a temporary hack, you may remove #include <stdlib.h> from all
    the files.)

*   Install the executables in an appropriate place.  Or type:

        make install

*   Copy the maps to a suitable place (as specified in the config.h file).
    On our system we have the LIBDIR set to /user/local/games/lib/xpilot.
    An /bin/ls -l on this directory gives:

        total 500
        -rw-r--r--   1 bjoerns  staff        739 Jun 25 02:27 defaults
        -rw-rw-rw-   1 bjoerns  staff     29859  May  5 21:32 log	(+)
        drwxr-xr-x   2 bjoerns  staff      1024  Apr  5 16:16 maps
        -rw-r--r--   1 bjoerns  staff       320  Jun 20 13:20 motd
        -rw-r--r--   1 bjoerns  staff       320  Jun 20 13:20 motd

    (+)Note, if you have logging enabled you will have to touch a file called
       log in the LIBDIR and give other users write permission to it. This is
       necessary since xpilot hasn't, and shouldn't have, the setuid bit set.

    Also note that the `motd' isn't included, you should make one yourself
    if you feel the need for it.

*   If you want to use sound (rplay or NCD displays needed, see the Imakefile
    or Makefile.std for more details), copy the src/lib/sounds file
    to LIBDIR+"sounds".

*   Copy the manual pages to a suitable place.  You may succeed with:

        make install.man

    If you don't know where to put them, don't bother.  You may still read
    them with the following command:

        nroff -man <man-file> | col | more

Remember to include the version of XPilot, your platform, the symptoms
and a fix (if you have one) when reporting bugs.

Check out the contrib directory and the contrib/xpmtp subdirectory for
some extra nifty programs.  Don't forget to get xmapedit from ftp.cs.uit.no
in the directory /pub/games/xpilot/contrib.  Look in the same place for
more XPilot contributed tools.

There is a mailing list for XPilot - please send an email to
xpilot-request@cs.uit.no with subject `info' if you want to know more.

There is a newsgroup for XPilot: alt.games.xpilot.
