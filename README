This is the README file for XPilot 3.6.2.

Copyright © 1991-96 by Bjørn Stabell, Ken Ronny Schouten & Bert Gijsbers.

Please see the LICENSE file for further details.  You may not
distribute this project without all the documentation,
source code, and the LICENSE file.



Installation instructions are in the INSTALL file.

VMS users should examine the contrib/VMS subdirectory and read the
README.VMS which is in there.

The documentation for XPilot is far from complete.  The map format is
only explained in doc/README.MAPS and doc/README.MAPS2, not in the server
manual page, xpilots(6).  The client manual page, xpilot(6), is more or
less up to date.

For further reading, see the manuals in the doc/man directory.

CONTRIBUTED SOFTWARE

Check out the contrib directory and the contrib/xpmtp subdirectory for
some extra nifty programs.  Especially TkXpInterface is a very convenient
program for starting the xpilots and xpilot programs.
Don't forget to get xmapedit from ftp.xpilot.org in the directory
/pub/contrib.  It allows you to create and modify XPilot maps.
Look in the same place for more XPilot contributed tools.
