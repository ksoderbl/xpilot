REQUIREMENTS:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\

XPilot require the following resources:

    - A UNIX machine    (Tested on HP9000 300 and 700 series and on SUN's)
    - An ANSI compiler  (GCC with no options should work just fine)
    - X11               (Only R4 tested)
    - A color display   (Might work on monochrome displays but not tested)

Also note that XPilot is not kind on the network or on the X server, so a
fast machine in a fast network is the ideal situation.



INSTALLATION:
\\\\\\\\\\\\\

*   Cd to the src directory.

*   Edit the config.h and Imakefile files to suit your environment.

*   Issue the following commands:

        xmkmf
        make Makefiles
        make depend
        make

*   Copy the maps to a suitable place (as specified in the config.h file).
    On our system we have the LIBDIR set to /user/local/games/lib/xpilot.
    An /bin/ls -l on this directory gives:

        total 500
        -rw-r--r--   1 bjoerns  siving90      36  Feb 12 19:29 help.txt
        -rw-rw-rw-   1 bjoerns  siving90   29859  May  5 21:32 log
        drwxr-xr-x   2 bjoerns  siving90    1024  Apr  5 16:16 maps
        -rw-r--r--   1 bjoerns  siving90      80  May  1 13:20 motd.txt

    (Note, if you have logging enabeled you will have to touch a file called
    log in the LIBDIR and give other users write permission to it (this is
    neccessary since xpilot hasn't, and shouldn't have, the setuid bit set.))

*   Copy the manual pages to a suitable place.  If you don't know where to
    put them, don't bother.  You may still read them with the following
    command:

        nroff -man <man-file> | more
