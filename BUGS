Default visual is used, not proper one.  (I.e. someone with TrueColor as
default visual cannot play the game, even if the X server supports
PseudoColor too.)

Sometimes you're able to lock on yourself.

The ball-string has doesn't take heavy tension, it produces wild, lethal
occilations.

Ball should be affected by object collisions.

When you're hit from a no-player smart shot, it says 'Playername was
hit by Playername'.

The game should handle different font sizes properly, for instance the
help windows tend to look strange (this might be partly solved if we
distribute XPilot with our own font).

Radar should draw real blocks, not just pixels

Players can fly through walls at high speed, this isn't the case for
objects (they use different collision detection methods).

The Delta_mv() routine doesn't appear to work correctly.  This is easiest
seen with many items - you are thrown to the right all the time.
