KNOWN BUGS
==========
- Doesn't handle limited dogfight properly, don't use until fixed (the mode
  isn't very popular).
- Doesn't always manage to contact server (could be I'm pouring too many
  packets into the buffers at once).
- Sometimes you will be able to contact the server, but the double
  buffering cannot be initialized.
- Doesn't handle monocrome displays at all, needs at least 4 (?) bitplanes.
