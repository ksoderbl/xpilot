Default visual is used, not proper one.  (I.e. someone with TrueColor as
default visual cannot play the game, even if the X server supports
PseudoColor too.)

The ball-string has doesn't take heavy tension, it produces wild, lethal
occilations.

Ball should be affected by object collisions.

Players can fly through walls at high speed, this isn't the case for
objects (they use different collision detection methods).
