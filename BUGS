<BUG>	001
<STATUS>open/low
<VER>	2.0
<DESC>	kenrsc
	The ball-string has doesn't take heavy tension, it produces wild,
	lethal occilations.
<WORK>	kenrsc
	What to do we do with this one. My suggestion is to drop
	the ball when the string stretches too far. What is yours?
<WORK>  930919: bert
	I don't see this bug as a problem.  When manouvring the ball
	the player should take care not to have it oscillate too strong
	or the player should find a way to reduce to oscillations.
	But I may not have seen the effect this bug refers too.

<BUG>	002
<STATUS>open/low
<VER>	2.0
<DESC>	bjoerns
	Ball should be affected by object collisions. 

<BUG>	003
<STATUS>deferred/low
<VER>	1.2
<DESC>	unknown
	Players can fly through walls at high speed, this isn't the case for
	objects (they use different collision detection methods).

<BUG>	004
<STATUS>open/low
<VER>	3.0.4
<DESC>	930900: kenrsc@stud.cs.uit.no
	Limited lives.  New human players are dead when entering a game
	where somebody has lost a life. This is not true for robots.
<WORK>  930915 kenrsc@stud.cs.uit.no
	Bert did you not change it so that if robots where left in the game
	it would start over again ? If so, does it do anything harm having
	the robots entering. Lowered the status to low since robots wont
	join in to often.
<WORK>  930919: bert
	I don't expect that adding more robots will be a problem.
	If only robots are alive then they have won the game and the
	game resets.

<BUG>	005
<STATUS>open/low
<VER>	2.0
<DESC>	930900: kenrsc@stud.cs.uit.no
    	The treasure is not correct. Sometimes the ball disapears for
	good.  There are also other things, but I don't remember now.

<BUG>	006
<STATUS>fixed
<VER>	3.0.4
<DESC>	930910: kenrsc@stud.cs.uit.no
	Mychar for robots 'R' disapears when robots has been dead in
	limited lives.
<WORK>	930911: bert@mc.bio.uva.nl
	Fixed it I hope.

<BUG>	007
<STATUS>open/medium
<VER>	3.0.3
<DESC>	930909: alt.games.xpilot
	If you release too many tanks at once the server hangs.
<WORK>  930919: bert
	Couldn't reproduce it.  My experiment was to see if it had
	anything to do with not having enough bases.  I don't know if
	tanks need bases at all.
<DESC>	931001: Derek C. Richardson (dcr@mail.ast.cam.ac.uk)
	Had that tank bug again yesterday: swa launched two tanks directly
	in my face and the server froze with the message:
	   Write socket buffer not big enough (4096,4085,"%c%c%c")
	Has any progress been made with this problem? Has anyone else HAD the
	problem? (we're running SunOS 4.1.x on Sparc IPX's and 10's here).
	Also with tanks: when they're launched they show up in the player list,
	with an amazing negative score (-500 or so). What happens if all the
	bases are occupied so that there is actually no more room for players?
	(this was the case last night). Could this be the origin of the problem?
<WORK>  931001: bert
	Made some small fixes which hopefully solve this problem.
	Tanks weren't properly excluded from certain player calculations.
	Tanks don't need (and didn't use) bases, but this wasn't properly
	reckoned with at all places.
	Clients shouldn't get homebase info for tanks.

<BUG>	008
<STATUS>open/low
<VER>	3.0.3
<DESC>	930912: chc@dale.ksc.nasa.gov (Charles Curley)
	Has anyone else noticed that on when you get near the edge of a
	wrapped map that you can't shoot when you nose is within say 20
	pixels of the edge?
<WORK>	930912: bert
	The problem is that when the center of a player is close to the edge
	then the expression "shot->pos = pl->pos + ships[dir].pts[0]" may
	result in a value bigger than the mapwidth/height.

<BUG>	009
<STATUS>open/low
<VER> 	3.0.4
<DESC>	930920:	kenrsc@stud.cs.uit.no (Ken Ronny Schouten)
	If a player hit a mine you have placed somewhere the point of that
	mine will show up on the position you are now. This is wrong. It 
	should only show up on your hud.

<BUG> 	010
<STATUS>fixed
<VER>	3.0.4
<DESC>	930923: kenrsc@stud.cs.uit.no (Ken Ronny Schouten)
	If you iconify your window during limited lives it does not always
	pop up again. I think this has something to do with the locking on
	different people. I have never experienced this bug when not locking
	on someone during a game.
<WORK>  930928: kenrsc@stud.cs.uit.no (Ken Ronny Schouten)
        Fixed it I hope :) The status field for the player that was sent over
        was for the player you where locked on when you where dead and not
	the status field for yourself. Changed this and now it seems to work
	just fine.

<BUG> 	011
<STATUS>fixed/medium
<VER>	3.0.4
<DESC>	930930: Charles Curley (chc@dale.ksc.nasa.gov)
	Cloaks don't seem to work sometimes.  Mostly with three of more
	people we will have a situation where some players can see
	others all the time regardless of the others cloak situation.
	eric@soda.berkeley.edu (Eric van Bezooijen):
	We here have also noticed the cloak problem.  We are running
	everything on Solaris 2.x on Sparc-boxes.  It is quite rare,
	however.  It is just like he describes.  Once in a while there
	will be a player playing who I can always see, regardless whether
	or not he has cloaking or not, with dashed lines around his ship...
<WORK>	931001: bert
	Had a thorough look at all of the visibility code and made
	a possible fix.  The updateVisibility flag is now explicitly set
	when a player reenters the game.  It appeared that the lastChange
	flags in the player visibility structure were nowhere initialised.

<BUG> 	012
<STATUS>fixed/low
<VER>	3.0.4
<DESC>	931001: Derek C. Richardson (dcr@mail.ast.cam.ac.uk)
	Have you noticed that you can shoot your own tank down and get
	points for it? Nice way to bump up your sccore ((this practice
	is frowned upon here of course).
<WORK>	931001: bert
	This was true for maps without player shielding (noshields)
	were tanks didn't have shields either.  Changed it to have
	tanks three seconds of shields after they are released.
	This makes it difficult to shoot your own tank.
	The OBJ_SHIELD flag was set in the status field instead
	of the used field.  Ouch!
