KNOWN BUGS
==========
- Use proper visual, not default one.
- Doesn't handle limited dogfight properly, don't use until fixed (the mode
  isn't very popular).
- Doesn't always manage to contact server (could be I'm pouring too many
  packets into the buffers at once).
- Sometimes you're able to lock on yourself.
- Ball isn't removed when you're killed.
- Ball should be afflicted by collisions.
- When you're hit from a no-player smart shot, it says 'Playername was
  hit by Playername'.
- Cloning bug, if you die after hitting 'r' the clone doesn't die but
  becomes a robot.

Subject: Cloning bug in xpilot
Status: RO

Is cloning yourself an advertised feature?  Unadvertised?  A bug?
Hit 'q' for self distruct, then let go of a tank with 'r', and if you
self distructbefore the tank dies of other things, you both come back.
The "clone" is marked with a "T" the same way robots are marked with
an "R".  It acts like a robot, but has your name.  I think it is a
"pseudo" player in the game.

Anyway.
After somebody clones themselves, and then everybody exits the game,
the server doesn't die.

It does die if nobody clones themselves.

This is on a DECstation 3100,
ULTRIX V4.2 (Rev. 96) System #8: Tue Jun 23 17:49:17 PDT 1992
UWS V4.2 (Rev. 272)

compiled with gcc
gcc -O -DFUNCPROTO -DLOCALGURU=\"...\" -DLIBDIR=\"...\" -c xpilot.c
...

It is just an annoyance.
