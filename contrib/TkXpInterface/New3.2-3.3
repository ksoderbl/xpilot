Hi All !
Some improvements :

- You can now start TkXpInterface as xpilot Client or Server or Client&Server 
  interface.
- You can change the initial items values of your local server
  without restarted it.
- Now a SINGLE-Click with your left mouse button is enough to
  to select a map, a remote server,...
- I read the Default file and the Dump only once (fastest)
  (thanks to Rene Boe (rene@iesd.auc.dk))
- I have added a "Score table filename" button EVEN IF it's not still
  avalaible in xpilots-3.1.3 
- If you save a map file or execute the Server, only the modified
  values will be written (if you want) or pass on the Xpilots command line.
- I have changed the order and the position of the windows corresponding
  to the upper buttons to avoid some truncated windows.
- The use of the Meta-server menu have change
  (thanks to Nick (vargish@sura.net)).
- In the Meta-server menu (sort window) you can see an entry box 
   it's useful if you want to look for a friend (with his nick name or
   e-mail adress), a map name, all .fr servers, etc....
   - The search mode doesn't take into account the difference between the
    lowercases and uppercases.
   - You must enter AT LEAST 3 characters for each word.
   - the servers names, that correspond to this criterion, will be displayed
     with another color
   - The number of remote servers that correspond to this criterion will be
     displayed on the header of the servers list "( #number servers found )".
   - If you put your mouse pointer inside the list of
     servers these servers names will retrieve the normal color, so use the
   - scroll bar to look for the servers BEFORE to put your mouse pointer
     inside the list.

  the servers names, that correspond to this criterion, will be displayed
  with another color, but if you put your mouse pointer inside the list of
  servers these servers names will retrieve the normal color, so use the
  scroll bar to look for the servers BEFORE to put your mouse pointer inside
  the list.
- The sort choice, the words you look for and the previous remote server you
   selected doesn't change even if you close and open the servers window
  (thanks to Bert (bert@mc.bio.uva.nl)).
- A Status button have been added. (same as the "S" command on the xpilot client
  command line).
- You can select or unselect a new ship shape.
- You can enter a new nick name.
- The servers window a new column to show if this remote server is in team mode
  and the info windows will show you the team number of each player, very 
  useful for the set of your team number before to play.
  but Attention !
    The team mode information will be used for Xpilots-3.1.4 and later !
    not still implemented.

- During the installation in the Makefile, the user can set a filter for
  the remote servers with the Xpilots version to avoid the display of 
  some old and incompatble version of xpilots.

- During the installation in the Makefile, the user can customize the
  set of colors used by TkXpInterface.

- A "Check options" button avoids or not the display of the options unknown
  by Xpilots when you load a map (thanks to Nick (vargish@sura.net)) .

- When you save a map file the original options unknown by Xpilots will be
  saved too ( to keep some options of "unofficial" patchs).

- When you start a server, the original options unknown by Xpilots will be
  added on the Xpilots command line.

- etc.......
