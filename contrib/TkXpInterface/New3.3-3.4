Hi All !

Some fixed buggs :

    - Color fixed for the text on the bitmap (when an error occurs
      on the maps2image program)
       Thanks to Hugues Crepin (chugues@droopy.inria.fr)
    - If TkXpInterface is executed in background the telnet don't crash :
       Thanks to Bert Gijsbers (bert@mc.bio.uva.nl)
    - The filter of the remote server list is based on the lexically order.
       Thanks to Bert Gijsbers (bert@mc.bio.uva.nl)
    - The temporary file (tkxpI.upd) is suppressed.
       Thanks to Hugues Crepin (chugues@droopy.inria.fr)

Some improvements :

- The server mode accepts the new xpilots options :
  maxMissilesPerPack
  detonateItemOnKillProb
  itemEmergencyShieldProb
  initialEmergencyShields
- The server mode accepts the New ship shapes format but DOESN'T verify
  if it is accepted by your current client.

- The ship shapes definition (in TkXpI.shp) accepts the multilines format.
- You can for a running local server (without restarted it.):
     - change the initial items values
     - change the number of robots
     - Lock or Unlock the game
     - Shut down or Stop the shut down
     - Send a message of God to the player 
- The "Search" entry box in now on the main panel of the metaserver menu.
- In the Meta server menu, the results of the "Status" option is filtered.
- In the installation in the Makefile, the user can set a filter for
  the remote servers with the Xpilots version to avoid the display of 
  some old and incompatble version of xpilots.
- For the monochrome displays, TkXpInterface is in Black on White,
  the "-reverse" option on the  TkXpInterface commande line toggles it
  in White on Black.

- etc.......
