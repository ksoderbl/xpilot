			CHANGELOG FILE

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 3.8.0 by Bert Gijsbers <bert@xpilot.org>

  - Updated to use Tcl/Tk version 8.0
  - Use meta.xpilot.org instead of xpilot.cs.uit.no.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 3.7.3

  - New update option in the Item Setup Menu from the Update server window.
  - New client option MaxFPS in the meta server window, local server window
    and right panel on the client & server main window.
  
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 3.7.2

  - New update server window, which allow you to modify more options during
    game. Use menu inside update server window to have the options which
    are configurable when you want to update a server. 
  - New Makefile with a TOPDIR variable (better when all the variable begin
    with the same path)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 3.7.1

Some fixed bugs
  - If one ShipShape has an error, then Tk continue telling the error.
    Consequence is that this shape won't be totally in the list.
  - When you choose a ship then the real name appears in the list (actually,
    "?" appears and not the name)

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 3.7

Please try TkXpInterface -info to get an overview of the new options.
(with 2 - (with 1 - you'll get the help for wish)).

Some fixed bugs
  - Thanks to Christian Engstler (engstler@mat1.uibk.ac.at) for his bug report
about the Max player shots (min was 1, not useful for map with no bullets like
Zap!.

Some new improvement:
  - You can choose now which file TkXpInterface will read to make shipShape
(TkXpI.shp or/and .xpilotrc). ShipShape lines MUST begin with
xpilot.shipShape:
                ^
                |
        ---------
Tk will read the 2 fields NM and AU (for name and author) but doesn't care about
the author. If you don't have NM field then the name of your ship will be "?".
Like this you will be able to change the TkXpI.shp each week when you'll
receive the Weekly Ship Shape Listing from John E. Norlin
I thought this definition is the new standard so I modified Tk to behave like ot
hers.
  - All the new xpilot-3.2.6 options are in the new window "Race".

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 3.6.2

some new improvement:
  - You can follow the making of the ship shapes on the first window.
  - Each user has his own files TkXpI.srv and TkXpI.mp, like this you can be 
more than one to use TkXpInterface and no having problem when updating server
or changing map at the same time.
  - The help is correct for the new server options added in TkXpI-3.6
  - A default ship button to retrieve the default ship (your .xpilotrc's ship)
  - Your nick name is read in your .xpilotrc file and show in the nick name 
entry.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 3.6.1

An only new thing:
  - To choose team -1 means that you want no team in the xpilot client prompt.
Ex:
Team 0 => xpilot -join <server> -team 0  .....
Team -1 => xpilot -join <server> .....

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 3.6

Some new things:
  - A new window to see local servers (using xpilot -list command)
  - You can change your nick name in the main window for client&server interface
  - All the new xpilot-3.2.5 server options : treasuresOnRadar (in Radar window)
, targetSync (in Team window), itemConcentratorRadius (in Misc window)
  - You won't find playerMinimumStartFuel option so MODIFY your maps.
  - Gravity error repaired (about the fact that you can have a
gravityPointSource without clockwise or anti-clockwise effect).
Some fixed bugs :
	- An error when making the prompt by comparison with default options. 
TkXpInterface-3.5 didn't save map default options so prompt didn't show what
user wanted really as options.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 3.5.1

Some fixed bugs :
 -Thanks to Mike Morrison <mmorriso@mipos2.intel.com>
  "There is a minor bug in TkXpInterface which reads the incorrect options
   for booleans when the option is capitalized (e.g. LaserIsStunGun: False)
   won't work  because False is capitalized."
 -Thanks to Juha Leskel <jussa@cherry.modeemi.cs.tut.fi>
 "When using TkXpInterface to find servers from the meta server, the update
  doesn't work as it should."

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Release 3.5

Add some new server options for Xpilot-3.2.3:
     -minVisibilityDistance or minVisibility <real>
       Minimum block distance for limited visibility, 0 for default
     -maxVisibilityDistance or maxVisibility <real>
       Maximum block distance for limited visibility, 0 for default
     -rogueHeatProb <real>
       Probability that unclaimed missile packs will go rogue.
     -rogueMineProb <real>
       Probability that unclaimed mines will activate.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------	
Release 3.4

Some improvements :
 - You can now change the size of the Meta-server list window.
 - Display, on the window from where you execute TkXpInterface,
   the new format of all ship shapes that are in old format in
   the TkXpI.shp file.

     - Shut down or Stop the shut down
     - Send a message of God to the player 
- The "Search" entry box in now on the main panel of the metaserver menu.
- In the Meta server menu, the results of the "Status" option is filtered.
- In the installation in the Makefile, the user can set a filter for
  the remote servers with the Xpilots version to avoid the display of 
  some old and incompatble version of xpilots.
- For the monochrome displays, TkXpInterface is in Black on White,

Release 3.2

Hi All !
Some improvements :

- You can now start TkXpInterface as xpilot Client or Server or Client&Server 
  interface.
- You can change the initial items values of your local server
  without restarted it.
- Now a SINGLE-Click with your left mouse button is enough to
  to select a map, a remote server,...
- I read the Default file and the Dump only once (fastest)
  (thanks to Rene Boe (rene@iesd.auc.dk))
- I have added a "Score table filename" button EVEN IF it's not still
  avalaible in xpilots-3.1.3 
- If you save a map file or execute the Server, only the modified
  values will be written (if you want) or pass on the Xpilots command line.
- I have changed the order and the position of the windows corresponding
  to the upper buttons to avoid some truncated windows.
- The use of the Meta-server menu have change
  (thanks to Nick (vargish@sura.net)).
- In the Meta-server menu (sort window) you can see an entry box 
   it's useful if you want to look for a friend (with his nick name or
   e-mail adress), a map name, all .fr servers, etc....
   - The search mode doesn't take into account the difference between the
    lowercases and uppercases.
   - You must enter AT LEAST 3 characters for each word.
   - the servers names, that correspond to this criterion, will be displayed
     with another color
   - The number of remote servers that correspond to this criterion will be
     displayed on the header of the servers list "( #number servers found )".
   - If you put your mouse pointer inside the list of
     servers these servers names will retrieve the normal color, so use the
   - scroll bar to look for the servers BEFORE to put your mouse pointer
     inside the list.

  the servers names, that correspond to this criterion, will be displayed
  with another color, but if you put your mouse pointer inside the list of
  servers these servers names will retrieve the normal color, so use the
  scroll bar to look for the servers BEFORE to put your mouse pointer inside
  the list.
- The sort choice, the words you look for and the previous remote server you
   selected doesn't change even if you close and open the servers window
  (thanks to Bert (bert@mc.bio.uva.nl)).
- A Status button have been added. (same as the "S" command on the xpilot client
  command line).
- You can select or unselect a new ship shape.
- You can enter a new nick name.
- The servers window a new column to show if this remote server is in team mode
  and the info windows will show you the team number of each player, very 
  useful for the set of your team number before to play.
  but Attention !
    The team mode information will be used for Xpilots-3.1.4 and later !
    not still implemented.

- During the installation in the Makefile, the user can set a filter for
  the remote servers with the Xpilots version to avoid the display of 
  some old and incompatble version of xpilots.

- During the installation in the Makefile, the user can customize the
  set of colors used by TkXpInterface.

- A "Check options" button avoids or not the display of the options unknown
  by Xpilots when you load a map (thanks to Nick (vargish@sura.net)) .

- When you save a map file the original options unknown by Xpilots will be
  saved too ( to keep some options of "unofficial" patchs).

- When you start a server, the original options unknown by Xpilots will be
  added on the Xpilots command line.

- etc.......
