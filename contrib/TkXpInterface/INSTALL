BUGS :
TkXpInterface was ONLY tested on :
                  HP 9000/735 running HP-UX 9.01
                  SUN Sparc server 1000
                  IBM Risc 6000

-The TkXpInterface is now adapted for the monochrome screen, if you
 have some Black&White problem type : "TkXpInterface -reverse"

-If after the sort of the current servers (in the meta-server command)
the servers are not sorted, that's mean TkXpInterface doesn't recognize YOUR
"sort" unix command, e-mail me its exact syntax to include it in the next version.

The syntax of the UNIX command depend of the machine you used :
TkXpInterface calls some UNIX commands, if you see a strange behavior
of TkXpInterface e-mail me the Tcl error message :
The UNIX commands used are :
      grep sort sed telnet cat rm mv cp ls echo tail head ping

e-mail troubles to :
berne@ensisun.imag.fr And ferhati@aremihp.univ-lille1.fr

Enjoy !
