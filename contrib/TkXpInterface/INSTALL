- TkXpInterface includes a help, just Single-Click with the RIGHT button
  to have a help about the area where is you mouse pointer !
- There are now at least 140 ship shapes, so to have a fast load of this
  program, edit TkXpI.shp and delete the lines that don't correspond to
  your favorite shapes.
------------------------------------------------------------------

-The TkXpInterface is now adapted for the monochrome screen, if you
 have some Black&White problem type : "TkXpInterface -reverse"

-If after the sort of the current servers (in the meta-server command)
the servers are not sorted, that's mean TkXpInterface doesn't recognize YOUR
"sort" unix command, e-mail me its exact syntax to include it in the next version.

The syntax of the UNIX command depend of the machine you used :
TkXpInterface calls some UNIX commands, if you see a strange behavior
of TkXpInterface e-mail me the Tcl error message :
The UNIX commands used are :
      grep sort sed telnet cat rm mv cp ls echo tail head ping
