.TH TkXpInterface VERSION " June 1994"
.SH NAME
TkXpInterface \- a funky user interface for xpilots(6) (Client and/or Server)
.SH SYNOPSIS
TkXpInterface
.SH DESCRIPTION
.B TkXpInterface
will give you a window showing all maps in the default xpilot map directory.
On this machine it is set to \fBMAPDIR\fR. To choose a map file click on it,
the bitmap image of the map will be displayed. The default map file
you selected is \fBMAP\fR. TkXpInterface takes into account all options included in the 
map file you choose, and warns you if some options are unknown for Xpilots.
you can move in different directories when you click on the directory name or
when you type yourself the pathname, if the directory does'nt exist
you back to the default directory.

You can select a \fBship shape\fR for your client.
You can fix the \fBgravity\fR value with your mouse on the map drawing.

You will also get a series of buttons and sliders to configure the server.
.LP
The configuration options are all related to each other, the act of selecting
an option can cause the disabling of other options. For example, you cannot
select that you wish to have Nukes if you have specified that there are to
be no missiles.
.LP
Once you have selected the map that you wish to play and have set all
the configuration options, click on the \fBStart Server\fR button. This
will start the server in the background. You can start more than one server with
different configurations (map, options) but you must select different port
numbers.
.LP

You can also \fBSave Copy Delete\fR a map file and/or a compressed map file,
if you save the map file all options you selected will be saved too.
.LP

To play the game, click on \fBPlay the Game.\fR. This will start the
xpilot client.

You can connect to the Xpilots meta-server (non-interactive) 
\fBMETASERVER\fR to play on a foreign server.
All current servers can be \fBsorted\fR by names, FPS,...
Just pass your mouse cursor on the choosen server to display all
informations about it. If you click on a server name, and you
activate the "Connect" button your xpilot client will be connected
to this server.
You can do a \fBPing\fR on the remote server to test the connection.
Note : When you start the xpilots client (in background), wait some secondes to let it 
establish the connection !

\fBTkXpInterface\fR creates some temporary files (for the bitmap and meta-server files)
in the read/write \fBTEMPDIR\fR directory.

If you click with the right-button a help window will appear to explain you the area
where the mouse cursor is.
