^U Attention ! 
1) This program doesn't verify the data you enters. This means that if
   you choose some non-numeric values for the probabilities, your server 
   may have have a strange behavior.

2) TkXpInterface doesn't verify whether the map files are readable or
   writable. If you haven't the permission, Tcl will show you an error
   message.

Finally) If a Tcl error message occurs you MUST click on the "OK" button
   otherwise TkXpInterface will be frozen!
   If TkXpInterface is still frozen this error window is certainly behind
   the main panel or your keyboard is in Caps-locked mode!

 the installation of TkXpInterface.

 An asterix (*) after the map name means the map is compressed; it will
 be decompressed in the temporary directory with the name "TkXpI.mp" 
 follow by a number which is your session number.

 This temporary file will be deleted if you quit TkXpInterface normally.
 (i.e. Quit button, not <Control-c>).

 TkXpInterface will verify if all options in the map file are compatible with
 Xpilots-3.2.x, if not you will be given an error message in a window when  you
 load the map if you have switched on the ^R Check ^R options button.
 The ^U button ^U on ^U the ^U right of ^R Check ^R options button will show you if some options
 warnings occured.

 Before the map names list you can change the current directory :

 To default Dir : to go to the default dir (if you are lost).
          ..    : to go on the previous directory.
          ./xxx : to go to the xxx subdirectory
          ./    : to update the map list in the current directory (if another
                  user is working in this directory while you are using 
                  TkXpInterface, use this if you obtain "<mapfile> not found"
                  when you try to load a map)

 You can also change the path with the ^R Current ^R dir. entry box, but if you
 type a wrong path name, the new directory will be the default directory.

 The ^R Current ^R file: line show you the pathname and the name of the last
 loaded map.

   I see you have chosen the following during the installation :
   The temporary Dir: <TEMPDIR>
   The default Dir  : <MAPDIR>
   The default map  : <MAP>
   The default file : <DEFAULT>
   The compressor   : <ZCOMP>
       decompressor : <ZDCOMP>
       extention    : <ZEXT>

{TkXpInterface-VERSION  Help on Ship shapes :

 It displays the set of ship shapes read from TkXpI.shp file or xpilotrc.
 The ship shape you chose by a click on the name of the ship is
 used, of course, only by the xpilots client.
 Its name appears on the top of the list.

 During the reading of the ship shapes TkXpInterface verify if their
 definition is congruent with xpilot's rules ("math.c" file in the
 source of xpilots) it displays the errors in the window from where
 you launch TkXpInterface, but it doesn't reject these bad shapes,
 you will see "_!!" after the ship name under its drawing.

 Each drawing shows you the :
        shape, mainGuns, leftGuns, rightGuns, leftLights
        rightLights, engines, missileRacks.

 You can retrieve the Default ship (this of your .xpilotrc file) by 
 clicking a new time on the selected ship or on the Default ship button.

 You can edit TkXpI.shp file to add some new shapes but respect the
 format described in the header of this file.

 I see you have chosen the following during the installation :
   The directory where TkXpI.shp is : <LIBDIR>

{TkXpInterface-VERSION  Help on the right main panel : 

 If TkXpInterface doesn't find a valid motd file its button is
 desactivated.

 If the scoreTableFileName is an empty string its button is
 desactivated.

 If ^R Team ^R play ^R mode is On, the ^S Team menu is active and the
 ^R One ^R player ^R only button is switched off.

 If ^R One ^R player ^R only is On, the ^R Team ^R play ^R mode button is
 switched off and the ^S Team menu is desactivated. In the ^S Player menu
 only ^R Limited ^R lives and ^R Number ^R of ^R lives make a sense!

 The ^S Robots menu is active if the ^R Number ^R of ^R robots is greater than 0.

 The ^R Port ^R to ^R use value will be used by the next server or client you start.

 The ^R Team ^R to ^R join will be used by the next client you start.
 - NOTICE THAT TEAM -1 MEANS NO TEAM IN THE XPILOT CLIENT PROMPT !!

 The ^R Max ^R frame ^R per ^R second  will be used by the next client 
 you start.
 - NOTICE THAT MAXFPS -1 MEANS NO MAXFPS IN THE XPILOT CLIENT PROMPT !!
 
 The ^R Nick ^R name will be used by the next client you start.
 The first name you see was read in your .xpilotrc file.

 ^U Note : TkXpInterface doesn't take into account the motd and score files
        defined in the xpilots dump and defaults file but on those 
        defined during the installation !

 I see you have chosen the following during the installation :
   The motd file  : <MOTDFILE>
   The score file : <SCOREFILE>

This panel fixes the following Xpilots options :
    -/+reportToMetaServer or reportMeta

    -motd <string>
        File name for server-motd
    -scoreTableFileName or scoretable <string>

    -/+noQuit or noquit
        The server keeps running even if all players have left
    -/+onePlayerOnly

{TkXpInterface-VERSION  Help on Gravity :

 In the ^S Bounce menu :
  If you have chosen ^R Extra ^R border a thick line appears around the map's
  drawing.
  If you have chosen ^R Edge ^R bouncing a fine line appears around the map's
  drawing.
  If you have chosen ^R Edge ^R wrap no line appears around the map's drawing.

 The setting of the gravity is now a ^U PLEASURE, There are two methods :

    - manually with your keyboard on the acquisition area,
      but I know you know.

       - if the gravity is a point (Clockwise, Anticlockwise or nothing) and you
         enter some values greater than the map size, the map size will
         be set automatically.

    - with the mouse :

       - if the gravity is along a line, you can adjust the gravity
         (value and direction) by clicking (drag&drop) on the "elastic"
         line on the center of the map.

       - if the gravity is a point (Clockwise or Anticlockwise), you can
         adjust the gravity value if you click (move) on the border of the
         circle and the origin of the gravity if you click on its center.
         Generally the default values are 0,0 so to catch the center click
         on the upper-left on the map drawing.

       - in both cases the moves will instantaneously change the
         corresponding values in the acquisition area (under the map
         drawing).

^U Attention !
 If the "Problem with maps2image" message occures that means :
    - you haven't the correct version.
    - or the program isn't found
    - or you haven't the permission !

 If you enter these values manually, respect the format:
 <integer value> for the gravity line.
 <integer,integer> values for the gravity point. 

This panel fixes the following Xpilots options :
    -gravity <real>
        Gravity strength
    -gravityPoint <position>
        If the gravity is a point source, where does that gravity originate?
    -gravityAngle <real>
        If gravity is along a uniform line, at what angle is that line?
    -/+gravityPointSource
        Is gravity originating from a single point?
    -/+gravityClockwise
        If the gravity is a point source, is it clockwise?
    -/+gravityAnticlockwise
        If the gravity is a point source, is it anticlockwise?

    Please refer to the manual pages, xpilots(6) and xpilot(6),
    for more specific help.
