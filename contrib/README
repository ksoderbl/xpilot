This stuff is not directly part of XPilot, but it has been provided
because they fill some gaps in the current XPilot product.

The directory xpmtp contains a XPilot Map Transfer Protocol program,
which greatly facilitates uploading, downloading, previewing and generation
of XPilot maps.  With some extra features.  Made by Andrew Scherpbier.

wildmap.c is a new fancy XPilot map generator with a few options to tune
the characteristics of the generated map.  Try wildmap -help.

Maps2image takes a set of xpilot maps and builds a single PBM image
from them.  Each image is labeled with the map's name below it.
If you have a lot of xpilot maps, this is a simple way to remind
yourself of what the different maps are/look like.

TkXpInterface is a funky interface to various components of XPilot.
You can use it to tune all the server parameters interactively before
starting a server.  Or use it to join a server of your choice.
It also provides a comfortable interface to the XPilot Meta server.
