Please see the LICENSE file for further details.  You may not
distribute this project without all the documentation,

Installation instructions are in the INSTALL file.

NT and Win95 users should examine the contrib/NT subdirectory and read
the README.txt which is there.

VMS users should examine the contrib/VMS subdirectory and read the
README.VMS which is in there.

The documentation for XPilot is far from complete.  The map format is
only explained in doc/README.MAPS and doc/README.MAPS2, not in the server
manual page, xpilots(6).  The client manual page, xpilot(6), is more or
less up to date.

For further reading, see the manuals in the doc/man directory.

CONTRIBUTED SOFTWARE

Check out the contrib directory subdirectory for some extra nifty programs.
Especially TkXpInterface is a very convenient program for starting the
xpilots and xpilot programs.  Don't forget to get xmapedit from
ftp.xpilot.org in the directory /pub/contrib.  It allows you to create and
modify XPilot maps.  Look in the same place for more XPilot contributed tools.
