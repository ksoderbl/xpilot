	Mychar for robots 'R' disapears when robots has been dead in
	limited lives.
<WORK>	930911: bert@mc.bio.uva.nl
	Fixed it I hope.

	If you release too many tanks at once the server hangs.
<WORK>  930919: bert
	Couldn't reproduce it.  My experiment was to see if it had
	anything to do with not having enough bases.  I don't know if
	tanks need bases at all.
<DESC>	931001: Derek C. Richardson (dcr@mail.ast.cam.ac.uk)
	Had that tank bug again yesterday: swa launched two tanks directly
	in my face and the server froze with the message:
	   Write socket buffer not big enough (4096,4085,"%c%c%c")
	Has any progress been made with this problem? Has anyone else HAD the
	problem? (we're running SunOS 4.1.x on Sparc IPX's and 10's here).
	Also with tanks: when they're launched they show up in the player list,
	with an amazing negative score (-500 or so). What happens if all the
	bases are occupied so that there is actually no more room for players?
	(this was the case last night). Could this be the origin of the problem?
<WORK>  931001: bert
	Made some small fixes which hopefully solve this problem.
	Tanks weren't properly excluded from certain player calculations.
	Tanks don't need (and didn't use) bases, but this wasn't properly
	reckoned with at all places.
	Clients shouldn't get homebase info for tanks.

	If a player hit a mine you have placed somewhere the point of that
	mine will show up on the position you are now. This is wrong. It 
	should only show up on your hud.
<WORK>	Fixed the problem. It was a reference to the player position instead
        of the mine position in collision.c

	If you iconify your window during limited lives it does not always
	pop up again. I think this has something to do with the locking on
	different people. I have never experienced this bug when not locking
	on someone during a game.
<WORK>  930928: kenrsc@stud.cs.uit.no (Ken Ronny Schouten)
        Fixed it I hope :) The status field for the player that was sent over
        was for the player you where locked on when you where dead and not
	the status field for yourself. Changed this and now it seems to work
	just fine.

	Have you noticed that you can shoot your own tank down and get
	points for it? Nice way to bump up your sccore ((this practice
	is frowned upon here of course).
<WORK>	931001: bert
	This was true for maps without player shielding (noshields)
	were tanks didn't have shields either.  Changed it to have
	tanks three seconds of shields after they are released.
	This makes it difficult to shoot your own tank.
	The OBJ_SHIELD flag was set in the status field instead
	of the used field.  Ouch!
<WORK>	931116: bert
	The issue that remains is that a detached tank has very little
	fuel, so it can still be shot down easily if the player is
	persistent enough.  Dunno if we should care about that.
	Being able to cheat is something I tend to like in a nice game :-)

	This Zombie BUG can be quite annoying! One evening I was playing
	tournament on a norweigean server when it happened to Data. After I
	had quit he was still in the game. I later came back (had to invent
	the name Ups!) and saw that Zombie Mr. Data was really spoiling the
	game. It didn't take long for the other players to find out that Data
	and Ups!  where from the same host and I got accused of
	cheating/ruining the game on purpose. I tried different things to
	get my Zombie out but that was impossible. The owner of the server
	process was not logged on so no-one had permission to kick him.
	This BUG can be pretty annoying.
	I don't know too much about the UDP protocol, but I imagine, that if
	the packet containing QUIT! is lost then a thing like that may happen.
	How about inventing an acknowledgement scheme or a way to kick your
	*own* pilots ???
<WORK>	931004: bert
	The client/server protocol had a mechanism to automatically kick
	players out of the game if they didn't respond for about 40 seconds.
	I don't understand why this isn't working anymore (it used to work!).
<WORK>	911116: bert
	Fixed.  It was one of the most important fixes in 3.0.6.

	I usually leave the xpilot server up for as long as it will stay up
	(it tends to crash after a day or two 8).  I just pause when not
	playing.  Sometimes my fuel will be depleted when I return even if I
	had a full tank when I paused.
<WORK>	931020: bert
	It could be the case that at some places in the code
	a check for the player being paused is missing.
<WORK>	931021: Mr M J Cleaton
	The solution is simple - deactivate your shields before pausing.
<WORK>	931116: bert
	If I remember correctly this has been fixed in 3.0.6.

	If you play in limited lives mode and commit suicide you will lose
	a life but it will not show on the score list. I.e. if you commit
	suicide once when you have 3 lives the score list will tell you 3
	but you have only 2.
<WORK> 940204: kenrsc@stud.cs.uit.no (Ken Ronny Schouten)
	Fixed it. In update.c we have the test if the player comitted
        suicide, but we forgot to add the line updateScores = true.

	Ramdane FERHATI: Story of a bug !    11 Feb 1994 11:35
	I played yesterday, a tournament, my boss arrived in
	my office, so I put my ship in the pause mode and
	iconified the xpilot's window.
	I used another working window to have a hidden icon.
	I spoke with my boss, SUDDENLY, the tournament map
	appeared in the full screen !!!!!!
	AAAAAAAAAAAARRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
	(certainly because the current game was won by a player)
	is-it possible to add a hot-key (Escape key), to avoid
	a heart attack to my boss ?
<WORK>	940211: bert
	This should not happen.  Paused players should remain paused
	even if the game is restarted.
<DESC>  940213: kenrsc
	We also have the problem in 3.1 that the popup does not work
        at all. We also need a 'boss' button for this case. Next time 
        he may not have time to land his ship and pause it :)
<WORK> 940225: kenrsc
        Fixed the popup bug in 3.1. It was due to that the status field
        sent from server to client is a byte big. The GAME_OVER bit
        was set to 11..... This was not the case in version 3.0.7, there
        we had the following line.
	   #define GAME_OVER 8    /* This must not be above 8 */
        So my question is: How was it that moved it to 11 and removed the
        comment ? I should think that a warning like that in the comment
        should prevent it !
<WORK>  940226: kenrsc
        Fixed Ramdane Ferhati's problem :) We only popup the window if 
        game is over and the player is NOT paused.
