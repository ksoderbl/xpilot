[options] can be
  -font <string>
    Use this font instead of the default
  -display <string>
    Display mapeditor on this display instead of the current
  -help
    Output this help

if the user neglects to.

*********************************************************************
Changes to xmapedit V1.00 to bring it up to V3.5.1b

* I have updated the xmapedit editor to handle the new decorative
  map pieces.

* It now starts off with sensible options in the prefs window as
  opposd to no options set at all.
  
* Also alterred is the prefs window, which now allows alterring of all
  the options supported by xpilots3.5.1.  Unfortunately it doesn't
  range or validate the floating point values entered, so ensure
  they are correct before saving the map.
  
* It also has space on the menu for five other pieces, one is used
  by a diamond shape that adds an '^' (for patches to my server, or
  yours if you please!).  It needs the code fiddling to add more
  pieces, but the basic template for more is there.
