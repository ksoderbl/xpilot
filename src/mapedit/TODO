Working On
----------
You should make the MAPDIR configurable at least in the Makefile.
But perhaps also by a X resource.
Using a few more X resources would be nice.
 
LoadOldMap is reading version 1.0 maps, not 2.0.
 
The resize limits do not get set sometimes...

Someday will get to if enough people complain
----------------------------------------------
-DMONO option needs updating

Can't Reproduce ( need more info )
----------------------------------
Map name in save doesn't come up for bert.

Some of the blocks in the big drawing window are not correctly drawn
in the small window with the full map.  This may be due to not completely
correct subarea exposure drawing.  I don't know.


Enhancements ( feel free to contribute )
----------------------------------------
Why should the selection area always be a rectangle?  It would be nice
to have an arbitrarily shaped (polygon, etc) area to be filled by one
click.  Or if I draw a shape with a particular block (like solid)
then have that shape be filled with that particular block type after
another click on some button or so.

Apart from unlimited Undo which is very very nice, a Redo facility might
be nice too.

A more wider drawing pencil would be nice, like a brush or so.
It could also be a drawing thickness parameter of some kind.
This would aid in drawing the outlines of new (and big) map quickly.

It would perhaps be nice to have a generic Cannon symbol which would,
when used to draw with, draw a cannon with the base line attached to
the nearest wall.
