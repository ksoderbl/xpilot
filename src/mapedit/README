* Alter the Imakefile.  Specify the compiler.
  Edit the MAPDIR variable to point to the place where you keep your XPilot maps.

* Alter the defaults.h file if you want to, otherwise leave alone
* Alter the default_colors.h if you want to change any of the editor colors

* xmkmf -a

* make

Or if you don't have xmkmf or it doesn't work try fiddling with the original
makefile, called Makefile.dist

The original author Aaron Averill can no longer be contacted.
He donated xmapedit to XPilot <xpilot@xpilot.org> provided that his
name remains clearly recognizable as the principal author of xmapedit.
The changes made by William Docter and Robert Templeman were donated
to XPilot provided that xmapedit remains free and the source code
available to the public.
