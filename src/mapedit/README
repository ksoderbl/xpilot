* if xmapedit is being installed with xpilot, simply build xpilot as instructed
  by */xpilot-****/Install.txt


* If xmapedit is being installed apart from the xpilot source,
  run "Install". (This sets up the local Imakefile).

* Alter the new Imakefile.  Specify the compiler.
  Edit the MAPDIR variable to point to the place where you keep your XPilot maps.

* Alter the defaults.h file if you want to, otherwise leave alone
* Alter the default_colors.h if you want to change any of the editor colors

* xmkmf -a

* make


Or if you don't have xmkmf or it doesn't work try fiddling with the original makefile,
called Makefile.dist.

The original author Aaron Averill can no longer be contacted.
He donated xmapedit to XPilot <xpilot@xpilot.org> provided that his
name remains clearly recognizable as the principal author of xmapedit.
The changes made by William Docter, Robert Templeman, and Jarrod Miller were
donated to XPilot provided that xmapedit remains free and the source code
available to the public.
