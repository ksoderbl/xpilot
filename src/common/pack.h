 * Magic contact word.
 * The low 16 bits are the real magic word.
 * Bits 31-28 are the major version number.
 * Bits 27-24 are the minor version number.
 * Bits 23-20 are the patchlevel number.
 * Bits 19-16 are free to mean beta release or so.
 * These high bits only need to be changed when a new
 * client can't talk to an old server or vise versa.
 * Please don't change it more often than strictly necessary.
 * PLEASE NOTE: if you make your own private incompatible changes
 * justifying an increment of the version word then please
 * set the 4th bit.  Like 0x3108 and 0x3109 till 0x310F, etc.
 * This way we can use the lower 8 values for public releases.
 *
 * Reasons why it changed in the past:
 * 3.0.1: rewrite of contact pack protocol, because of
 * different structure layout rules on different architectures.
 * 3.0.2: rewrite of setup transmit from server to client to
 * make it possible for 64-bit machines and 32-bit machines
 * to join in the same game.  This was the last hardcoded
 * structure that was shared between client and server.
 * 3.0.3: implemented a version awareness system, so that
 * newer clients can join older servers and so that
 * newer servers can support older clients.
 * The client maintains a `version' variable indicating
 * the version of the server it has joined and the server
 * maintains for each connection a `connection_t->version'
 * and a `player->version' variable.
 * 3.0.4: the so-called `pizza-mode' introduced a new packet type.
 * The score packet now also includes pl->mychar.
 * 3.0.4.1: new laser weapon introduces another packet change.
 * Because there is an unofficial (and forbidden) 3.0.4 version floating
 * around the sub patchlevel number is used to distinguish versions.
 * A new display packet to tell the server what the view sizes are
 * and how many different debris intensities the client wants.
 * 3.0.4.2: new player-self status byte in self packet.
 * 3.0.4.3: different and incompatible laser packet.
 * New eyes packet to tell the client through wich players eyes we're
 * looking through in case the client is in game over move and it is locked
 * on someone else.
 * 3.1.0.0: new big patches implementing loads of new incompatible features.
 * Major cleanup.  Old clients (before 310) can't join new servers anymore.
 * 3.1.0.1: key-change-ids are now send as longs instead of bytes.
 * 3.1.0.2: different player status byte.
 * 3.1.0.3: different mine packet.
 * 3.2.0.0: New ship shape definition and big patches.
 * 3.2.0.1: Extended buffer for very large ship shape definitions.
 * 3.2.0.2: New mouse pointer control packet.
 * 3.2.5.0: Now client must ask for audio packets in order to get them.
 * 3.2.6.0: New map update packet.
 * 3.2.6.1: New player timing packet.
 * 3.2.8.0: New asyn packet.
 * 3.3.1.0: Different owner-only commands.
 * 3.3.2.0: Map decorations.
 * 3.4.0.0: Lose/drop item key.
 * 3.5.0.0: Player waiting queue.
 * 3.8.0.0: new items (deflector, hyperjump, phasing), keyboardsize and rounddelay.
 * 4.1.0.0: new item (mirror).
 * 4.2.0.0: new power/turnspeed behavior
 * 4.2.0.1: new item (armor).
 * 4.2.0.2: highest bit on in wreckagetype when deadly.
 * 4.2.0.3: different way of sending player item info.
 * 4.2.1.0: high bit in radar size means player is a teammate.
 * 4.3.0.0: transmit phasing separately from cloaking
 * 4.4.0.0: new object (asteroid)
 * 4.4.0.1: fast radar packet
 * 4.5.0.0: new team score packet; score packet made larger to send decimals
 * 4.5.0.1: temporary wormholes
