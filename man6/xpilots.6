.SH NAME
xpilots \- XPilot/UX  Multiplayer gravity war game server

.SH SYNOPSIS

.BR xpilots
[\fB-map \fImap-file\fP]
[\fB-robots \fInumber\fP]
[\fB-rawmode\fP]
[\fB-noquit\fP]
[\fB-help\fP]
[\fB-version\fP]

.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual explains the following topics:
.IP
.B - Setting up a server.
.IP
.B - Owner-only commands.
.IP
.B - Creating new maps.
.PP
Complete coverage of the game basics and how to connect to a server are
given in the manual pages for \fIxpilot(6)\fP.

.SS Options
.TP 15
.B -map \fImap-name\fP
This option allows you to select the map you will use for this server.  If
it is omitted, you will have to manage with a computer generated random
map.  For instructions on how to create a map, see below.
For example if 
.B -map blackhole
or the equivalent
.B -map blackhole.map
is passed as command line arguments, the server will try to locate a file
called \fBblackhole.map\fP in the current directory, or in a predefined
directory (default is /usr/local/games/lib/xpilot/maps/).

.TP 15
.B -help
Prints a short help, including the supported commandline options.

.TP 15
.B -version
Prints the current version.

.TP 15
.B -noquit
If this option is specified, xpilots won't quit when the last human player
exits.

.TP 15
.B -rawmode
If this option is specified, xpilots doesn't go to sleep when there are no
human players logged into the game.  The \fBnoquit\fP option must be
specified for this to have any effect after the first player joins the
game.

.TP 15
.B -robots \fInumber\fP
Tells the server that you want \fInumber\fP robots instead of the default -
number-of-bases/2.  A value of -1 will fill the entire server with robots.
Note however that there will always be room for one new player, the robots
will be kicked out of the game to accomodate for new players, they will
also enter the game when there is space for them.

.SS Prompt options (owner only)
If you are the owner of a server you have successfully connected to (with
\fIxpilot(6)\fP), you have several special commands available, all of which
applies to the current server only:
.TP 15
.B m
Send a message to the players.
.TP 15
.B k
Kick a player out of the game.  Currently, this command does not stop the
player from re-joining the game.  Hopefully, however, he or she would have
learned their lesson.
.TP 15
.B l
Lock/unlock the game.  This prevents other users from joining the game.
.TP 15
.B d
Shutdown/cancel shutdown.  This command will ask for a reason and a
shutdown delay (in ticks) and transmit these to the server.  A timer will
appear showing how much time is left before the game goes down.  If you
don't specify a delay, you will be canceling an already initiated shutdown.

.SH MAPS
Maps are currently implemented as plain ASCII-text files with the letters
having special meanings.  The required \fB.map\fP suffix is not allowed to
exist in any other part of the name.

.SS Format
The format of the map file is as follows:
.RS 6
.TP
.PD 0
\fIx-width\fPx\fIy-width\fP		(dimensions)
.TP
\fIrule-number\fP
.TP
\fImap-name\fP
.TP
\fIauthor-name\fP
.TP
\fImap-data\fP
.PD 1
.RS -6

.SS Contents
The \fIdimensions\fR are in blocks, with each character in the map-data
corresponding to one block.  If the x-dimension specification is smaller
than the actual map size, the map is cut off at that x-coordinate.  If it
is larger, the map is padded with blanks.  A similar rule applies in the
y-direction.

The following \fIrule\fR numbers are available:
.RS 6
.TP 6
.B 0
Custom.  Player killings, shield and limited visibility all enabled.
.TP
.B 1, 2
Reserved for future expansion.
.TP
.B 3
Race.  No player killings.
.TP
.B 4
Dogfight.  As custom but not with limited visibility.
.TP
.B 5
Dogfight (limited).  As for normal dogfight, but with limited lives.  When
a player gets \fBgame over\fP, he or she will not (re)enter the game until
the game declares and honors a winner.  The \fBdefault mode\fP for new
players is \fBgame over\fP.
.RS -6
.TP 0
The \fImap name\fR should be no longer than 60-80 characters and may
consist of spaces.  Though, a short and concise name is preferred.
.TP
The \fIauthor name\fR shouldn't need any explanation.  Please use real
name, nothing more, nothing less.
.TP
\fIMap data\fR contains the geography of the world.  Each character
represents a block in the world, and unknown characters are interpreted as
\fBspace\fP.  Avoid the use of \fBTAB\fP as the program will interpret it
as one character, while the normal editor will usually do an expansion.
.TP
\fINB!\fP This implementation will not handle auto-wraparound, a player
that leaves the play-field will be destroyed.  The best way to handle this
is to implement a frame of filled blocks around the playing area.  Also
note that you will have to comply with the maximum settings of the server,
so have a look at the map.h file in the distribution.

.SS Character descriptions
The following characters (case sensitive) have special interpretations:
.RS 8
.TP 4
.B x
A filled square/block.
.TP
.B q w s a
Filled triangles.  They are filled in these corners (same order as above):
down-right, down-left, up-left and up-right.
.TP
.B *
Starting position.  The number of starting positions determine how many
players the world can take.
.TP
.B F
Fuel station.  Obviously, this is a place where you can refuel.
.TP
.B + - < >
Positive, negative, curl anti-clockwise and curl clock-wise 'grav'
(gravitational source).  These will push or pull your fighter, depending on
the sign of the grav (positive/negative), or in the case of the curl gravs
- push your fighter around as if it were in a whirlpool (try it or ask some
physicist).
.TP
.B @
Blasters.  Mark points in the map, where star dust is created.  Star dust
consists of little stones, flying through the map.  Collisions with it have no
effect, if the shield is active.  Otherwise fuel is reduced.  This points are
not visible.
.TP
.B W I O
Wormholes. These work much like the famous SciFi term 'teleporting'.  Note that
it is not possible to have only one wormhole on a map, you must have none
or more than one.  'W's are bi-directional, 'I's (in) are enter-only.  'O's
(out) are exit-only.  Note that exit-only wormholes are invisible.
.TP
.B d r f c
Cannons.  They are pointing in the following directions (same order as
above): left, up, right and down.  These tend to make life difficult for a
novice player, go easy on them, will ya?
.TP
.B 0..9
Control posts.  These are only applicable in the \fBrace mode\fP.  The
track starts at 0, and the final posts are 9 and 0, thereby completing a
lap.
.TP
.B space (and every other characters)
Blanks.

.SH EXAMPLE

spaces)

.PP
If this is saved to a file with a \fB.map\fP suffix, you may try it with
the command:
.IP
.B xpilots -map <filename>
.PP

.SH NOTES
There are even special fonts which make editing maps even simpler.  They
are called \fBmap-5\fP, \fBmap-7\fP and \fBmap-9\fP.
.TP 0
To use them, you will probably have to add their directory to your
\fBfont-path\fP.  This is usually done with the \fIxset(1)\fR command, i.e.:
.PP
.IP
.B xset fp+ /usr/local/lib/X11/fonts
.IP
.B xset fp rehash
.PP
To use it with for example the \fIemacs(1)\fR editor, you will have to use
a command like:
.IP
.B emacs -fn map-9 mapfile.map
.PP
Remember though, that editing text with this font is virtually impossible.
