[ other sounds deleted ]

We played with these sounds and kept dying because we were laughing so hard!
Anyway, we also noticed that those simpsons sounds we have at our archive
had all kinds of clicks in them (at the beginning and end of each of the sounds)
so I spent some time with sun's audiotool to fix them up.
The fixed up versions are available from sounds.sdsu.edu in
/sounds/cartoons/simpsons
You can use either anonymous ftp or gopher to access the sounds.  (same host)

Have fun with them!
