%description
XPilot is a multi-player 2D space game. Some features are borrowed
from classics like the Atari coin-ups Asteriods and Gravitar, and
the home-computer games Thrust (Commdore 64) and Gravity Force
(Commodore Amiga), but XPilot has many new aspects too.
Highlights include: 
  - True client/server based game; optimal speed for every player. 
  - Meta server with up to date information about servers hosting
    games around the world. 
  - A web of world-wide rating servers; compare your skills with
    pilots from all around the world, and climb the ladder of the
    world-wide rating list. 
  - 'Real physics'; particles of explosions and sparks from your
    engines all affect you if you're hit by them. This makes it
    possible to kill someone by blowing them into a wall with
    engine thrust or shock waves from explosions. 
  - Specialized editors for editing ship-shapes and maps. 
  - Game objective and gameplay adjustable through a number of
    options, specified on the commandline, in special option files,
    or in the map files. Examples of modes of the game: 
      * classical dogfight; equipped with only your gun, you have
	to rely on your maneuvering and tactical skills 
      * team; fight together, steal other teams's treasures (involves
	flying around with a ball in a string, much like in Thrust)
	and blow up their targets (which are, no doubt, heavily guarded) 
      * all out nuclear war; chose carefully between more than 15 weapon
	and defense systems to stay alive and annihilate your enemies 
      * race; make it through the deadly course before your opponents 
  - Adjustable gravity; adjustable by putting special attractors or
    deflectors in the world, or by adjusting the global gravity in
    various ways. 
  - Cannons and personalized and vengeful robot fighters give you a
    hard time. 
  - Watch your energy, and remember to 'dock' with a fuel station to
    refuel before it's too late. 
  - Defend your home base, or terrorize and steal someone else's. 
  - Equip your ship with the 15+ defense and weapon systems: afterburners,
    cloaking devices, sensors, transporters, extra cannons, mines and
    bombs, rockets (smarts, torpedos and nuclear), ECM, laser, extra
    tanks, autopilot etc.
