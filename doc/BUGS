# Each bug has its unique number and some additional info.
# The <BUG> field has the number (this marks the start of the bug entry).
# The <STATUS> field can be: open|fixed|unconfirmed|deferred
# Additionally, one may have an extra /-separated priority modifier
# (low|medium|high), for example: <STATUS>open/medium.
# The <VER> field is the version the bug was reported against.
# The <DESC> field holds the person (+email) who reported the bug
# plus the description of the bug.
# The <WORK> field reports progress made on fixing it
# (same format as <DESC>).

# The six digit dates used here are in yymmdd format for easy sorting.

# When refering to bugs one may use B+<the bug number>,

<BUG>	002
<STATUS>open/low
<VER>	2.0
<DESC>	bjoerns
	Ball should be affected by object collisions. 

<BUG>	017
<STATUS>open/medium
<VER>	3.0.6
<DESC>	931125: bert
	There is a problem with the client getting corrupted frame updates.
	In a frame update the `loops' variable is printed twice.
	Once at the start of the frame and another time at the end of the
	frame.  The problem is that the client prints that the first value
	differs from the second value and therefore that the frame is
	corrupted and ignored.
	The second value is always the corrupted one.
	I would like to know if this is due to a bug in the sound packet
	code or not.  I.e., does a non-sound client experience this only
	with sound-packet-sending servers or with all servers.
	The sound packets are printed at the end of the frame, therefore
	that might (?) be a possible cause of this problem.

<BUG>	018
<STATUS>open/medium
<VER>	3.0.6
<DESC>	931210: ferhati@aremihp.univ-lille1.fr (Ramdane FERHATI)
	In the maps where there are no team bases, and you specify
	team play, nobody can join the server.
	I propose that the server randomly choses a team number for
	each non-team home base when in team mode.
<WORK>	931210: bjoerns
	At least, the server should warn about this condition.

<BUG>   025
<STATUS>open/low
<VER>   3.2.2
<DESC>  940615: boyns@hercules.SDSU.edu (Mark Boyns)
	*** Server on 129.186.5.2. Enter command> T
	Enter team: 2
	Team set to 2
	*** Server on 129.186.5.2. Enter command> 
	*** Login allowed
	debris 0 < 0
	xpilot: Received unknown packet type (84)
	xpilot: Bad net input
	I got this error using a 3.2.2 client with a 3.2.2 server.
	BTW, I've got the "Bad net input" before, but I've never
	seen the "debris 0 < 0" message.

<BUG>   029
<STATUS>open/medium
<VER>   3.2.6
<DESC>  941014: Karen Gould
	Sometimes in some maps on some servers for some players the weapon modifiers
	get cleared when reappearing on the homebase after a death.
<REMARK>960430: Aleksi Suhonen
	I think this is caused by the users' ClearModifiers-key
	getting 'stuck'. (I.e. the draw-window gets the keypress
	event, but not the keyrelease event.) If this is the case
	then this bug is reduced into another (I don't know should
	I call this a bug or a) feature, that when a new round
	starts, the client sends a keypress event to the xpilot
	server for each key that it thinks is depressed.

<BUG>   34
<STATUS>closed/high
<VER>   3.2.8
<DESC>  941124: Remy (Remy.Amouroux@imag.fr)
	For local tournament, I use a server 3.2.8 with a customized
	Tournament map.
	I have set the following options for that map :
	allowshields:false             // I used the no value too
	playerstartshielded:false
	initialemergencyshields:1
	The problem is the following:
	when the players start their session, they appear shielded
	and can use the normal shield until they use the extra-shield.
	After they totally used the extra-shield, they cannot use
	the normal shield. When they die, they return to the previously
	described state (shielded, ...) .
	Is it a bug or an option that I forgot ?
<WORK>	941130: Bert
	I tried to repeat it with the options given, but couldn't repeat it.
	Maybe it is fixed already?  If not let me know.
