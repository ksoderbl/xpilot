# The <STATUS> field can be: open|fixed|unconfirmed|deferred
# Additionally, one may have an extra /-separated priority modifier
# (low|medium|high), for example: <STATUS>open/medium.
# The <VER> field is the version the bug was reported against.
# The <DESC> field holds the person (+email) who reported the bug
# plus the description of the bug.
# The <WORK> field reports progress made on fixing it
# (same format as <DESC>).
#
# The six digit dates used here are in yymmdd format for easy sorting.
#
# When refering to bugs one may use B+<the bug number>,
